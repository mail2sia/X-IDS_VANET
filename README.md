## Overview

This work presents an **explainable ensemble-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for **Software-Defined VANETs (SD-VANETs)**.  
We combine:
- **Random Forest (RF)** and **CatBoost** as base models,
- **Logistic Regression (LR)** as the final meta-classifier,
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for explainability analysis.

The system is trained and evaluated on the **VeReMi dataset**, achieving strong detection rates with explainable model behaviour.

## Main Contributions

- **Stacked Ensemble Approach**:  
  Integration of Random Forest, CatBoost, and Logistic Regression.

- **Explainability with SHAP**:  
  SHAP interaction plots reveal how different features contribute to classification decisions.

- **High Detection Performance**:  
  - **Cross-validation Accuracy**: 98.83% ¬± 0.08%
  - **Overall Multiclass Accuracy**: 98.11%
  - **Binary Classification Accuracy**: 99.68%
  - **Attack-wise Detection Accuracy**:
    - BENIGN: 97.65%
    - Constant Attack: 100.00%
    - Constant Offset Attack: 99.74%
    - Eventual Stop Attack: 97.14%
    - Random Attack: 99.95%
    - Random Offset Attack: 99.10%

- **Analysis of Misclassifications**:  
  Eventual Stop Attack showed slightly lower precision (78%) compared to other attack types.

## SHAP Analysis

- **Random Forest (SHAP_RF.PNG)**:
  - Most influential features: `pos-x1`, `pos-y1`, `spd-x1`, and `spd-y1`.
  - Features `sender_1` and `messageID` had lower interaction importance.

- **CatBoost (SHAP_CatBoost.PNG)**:
  - Strong interactions observed for `pos-x1`, `pos-y1`, and `spd-y1`.
  - Clusters formed clearly distinguish benign versus attack traffic.

- **Observations**:
  - **pos-x1** and **pos-y1** coordinates were critical for attack detection.
  - **Eventual Stop Attack** misclassifications mostly linked to overlapping position-based features.
  - Minor confusion between BENIGN and Eventual Stop Attack categories in confusion matrix.
